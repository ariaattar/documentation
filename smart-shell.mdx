## Overview

Smart Shell provides an intelligent command-line interface that combines traditional terminal functionality with smart autocompletion. Execute dbt commands, Git operations, and standard Linux commands with intelligent assistance. The terminal knows about which files exist in your repository for enhanced suggestions.

<Tip>
Try asking questions in natural language and pressing Tab to get the right command suggestions for your needs.
</Tip>

## Smart Autocompletion

The special feature of Smart Shell is its intelligent autocompletion. When you:

1. **Type a partial command** and press `Tab`
2. **Ask a question** and press `Tab`
3. **Need help with syntax** and press `Tab`

The terminal will automatically suggest or complete the appropriate command for you.
