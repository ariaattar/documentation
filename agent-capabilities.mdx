## Overview

TensorStax agents are designed to verify every action they take, ensuring reliability and accuracy in your data workflow. The agent provides real-time feedback and validation for all operations it performs.

  <Accordion icon="cube" title="dbt Capabilities">
    
    ### <Icon icon="file-code" /> dbt Models

    **Creation & Editing**: Write new dbt models and edit existing ones with automatic verification.

    - Auto-generates preview of model output
    - Automatic error detection and fixing
    - File versioning for all changes
    - Can edit existing dbt models, YML files, tests, and macros

    ### <Icon icon="flask" /> Tests

    **Automated Testing**: Create and execute dbt tests with real-time results.

    - Tests auto-execute after creation
    - Agent receives immediate pass/fail feedback
    - Test results visible to users
    - Ensures data quality validation

    ### <Icon icon="file-lines" /> YML Files

    **Schema Management**: Create and maintain YML configuration files.

    - Schema definitions and documentation
    - Test configurations
    - Model properties and metadata

    ### <Icon icon="shield-exclamation" /> Safety Restrictions

    **Execution Boundaries**: The agent cannot perform destructive operations.

    - **Cannot** execute `dbt build`, `dbt run`, or change tables
    - **Cannot** modify database state directly
    - Users must press the play button to run models
    - Read-only access to database schemas and metadata
