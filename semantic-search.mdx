## Overview

Semantic Search provides an intelligent search experience that goes beyond simple file name matching. Search for errors, ask questions about models, or find files by context - all processed in real-time with no pre-built indexes.

## How It Works

The search bar understands natural language queries and semantic context:

- **Error Search**: Type error messages to quickly locate the problematic files
- **Contextual Queries**: Ask questions about models and their functionality  
- **File Name Search**: Traditional file name searches work seamlessly
- **Macro Discovery**: Find macros by describing what they do

## Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Medium Projects">
    **Under 500ms** - Fast results for typical dbt projects
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="database" title="Large Projects">  
    **Under 5 seconds** - Even projects with 1000s of files return results quickly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-Time Processing

<Note>
**No indexes stored** - Everything is computed in memory to ensure the most up-to-date results. Changes to your project are immediately searchable without rebuilding indexes.
</Note>

## Search Examples

### Error Detection
- Type error messages from your dbt runs
- The search will identify which specific files contain the errors
- Get direct navigation to problematic code

### Model Questions
- "Find the model that calculates customer lifetime value"  
- "Show me models that use the orders table"
- "Which model handles revenue calculations"

### Macro Discovery
- "Find macro that formats dates"
- "Show me the macro for data quality checks"
- "Macro that handles null values"

### File Search
- Standard file name searches work alongside semantic queries
- Partial names and patterns are supported
- Case-insensitive matching

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware**: Understands the purpose and functionality of your models
- **Error-Focused**: Quickly pinpoint files causing build failures  
- **No Maintenance**: No indexes to rebuild or maintain
- **Always Current**: Searches reflect your latest code changes immediately
- **Natural Language**: Ask questions in plain English

<Tip>
Try combining different search approaches - you can search for errors, then follow up with contextual questions about the affected models.
