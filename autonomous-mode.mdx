## Overview

TensorStax offers two execution modes to match your workflow preferences and project requirements. Choose between full autonomous execution or human-in-the-loop mode for greater control over the agent's actions.

## Mode Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="Human-in-the-Loop Mode">
    
    **Interactive Control**: The agent asks for confirmation after every plan step and before the session begins.
    
    - Review and approve each step before execution
    - Request plan updates before the agent starts
    - Redo any step as many times as needed
    - Move to the next step only when you're satisfied
    
    <Note>
    Even in human-in-the-loop mode, TensorStax will automatically attempt to fix dbt model errors on its own before asking for your input.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Autonomous Mode">
    
    **End-to-End Execution**: The agent executes the complete plan without interruptions.
    
    - Runs the entire plan from start to finish
    - Self-corrects when errors occur
    - Automatically retries failed steps
    - Continues until the expected result is achieved

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Post-Execution Editing">
    
    **Flexible Corrections**: Regardless of execution mode, you can always make changes afterward.
    
    - Use Quick Edit for simple modifications
    - Access Open Editor View for comprehensive changes
    - Manual file editing is always available
    - Make adjustments even after autonomous completion

## Choosing the Right Mode

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Human-in-the-Loop When:" icon="user-check">
    - Working on critical production models
    - Learning how TensorStax approaches problems
    - Need to review each step for compliance
    - Want to customize the approach mid-execution
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Autonomous When:" icon="bolt">
    - Prototyping or exploring data
    - Working on non-critical development tasks
    - Trust the agent's decision-making
    - Need fast iteration and results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Best Practice**: Start with human-in-the-loop mode for new projects to understand TensorStax's approach, then switch to autonomous mode for similar tasks once you're comfortable with the patterns.
