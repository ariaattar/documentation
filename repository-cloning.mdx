The process for connecting GitHub and GitLab repositories is identical. Follow these steps for either platform:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Navigate to Integrations">
    First, click on the **Integrations** tab at the top of the integrations page to swap from data connectors to other integrations.

    <img
      className="hidden dark:block"
      src="/images/git0.png"
      alt="Integrations Tab"
    />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Connect Your Platform">
    Click **Connect** under either the GitHub or GitLab section to begin the OAuth flow.

      alt="Connect Button"
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block"
      src="/images/github0.png"
      alt="Connect Button"
    />

    <Note>
      You'll be redirected to your chosen platform (GitHub or GitLab) to authorize TensorStax access to your repositories.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Select Repositories">
    During the OAuth flow, you'll be able to select which repositories you want TensorStax to be able to clone.

    <Tip>
      You can always modify repository access later in your platform's settings (GitHub or GitLab).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="eye" title="View Connected Repositories">
    Once you complete the OAuth flow and return to TensorStax, refresh the page to see the repositories you selected.
